# Medi Me

An application specifically for the Hong Kong market that solves the problem of finding the best medical specialist for your problem.
At a glance, it helps you understand:

1. Which type of medical specialist to visit
2. Who is the best medical specialist for you

We will start by scraping data from websites:

- [HK Licensed Medical Practictioners](https://www.mchk.org.hk/english/list_register/list.php?page=3&ipp=20&type=L)
- [Find Doc](https://www.finddoc.com/en/doctors)
- [See Doctor](https://www.seedoctor.com.hk/dr_detail-1.asp?dr_doctor=2724)
  - Note: Is in Cantonese so would likely need some help on this one

And later:

- [WebMD](https://symptoms.webmd.com/)
